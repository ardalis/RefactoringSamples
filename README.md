# Refactoring Samples

These samples are used in my Refactoring for C# Developers course on Pluralsight. A few of them are from my much more comprehensive older course, [Refactoring Fundamentals, which is slated to be retired but which you should be able to access through this direct link](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/refactoring-fundamentals).

You can find the latest version of them on GitHub:
